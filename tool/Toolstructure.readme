On this level 3 scripts:
- the preprocessor for the Worldpop data
- the preprocessor for the flood data
- the actual tool, now just the QMRA part

The folders represent different scenarios, in which the results of the two preprocessors are written. Also info of the run (what input & settings are used) should be available in each of the scenario folders.
In the actual tool, checks should be present that checks on the existence of folder & whether there is output in that folder
